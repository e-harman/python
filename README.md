# Python

My own practice work in Python. 

Currently I'm taking the [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) 5-course Specialization, [Python for Everybody](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python)
The honor code prevents me from uploading any of the class homework, so I am only able to upload sid projects I do.

Now a mix of Python 2 and Python 3 since the specialization switched to Python 3 mid-way through.
