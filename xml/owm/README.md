# OpenWeatherMap

Program to practice using the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api)

The point of the first program I've done, owm.py, is to practice using the API to access XML data. 
This is related to the course I took, [Using Python to Access Web Data](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-network-data).

This is for Python 3

To run this yourself you'll have to do a few things
* Obtain an API key from [OpenWeatherMap](http://openweathermap.org/appid)
* Rename hidden_key_sample.py to hidden_key.py
* Edit the hidden_key.py file to include your own API key
